## As you walk in...


Today, we'll "collect" some data from the class and record it in a file you can access at the link below

How many hours of sleep did you get last night? If you feel comfortable sharing, please type in a number corresponding to the number of hours of sleep you got. Round to the nearest hour.

We'll come back to this later in class.

## What is statistical inference (in a biostatistics context)?

A process that converts data into useful information, whereby practitioners

1.  form a question of interest
2.  collect and summarize data
3.  and interpret the results

## Identifying the population and question of interest  {.smaller}

The **population** is the group we'd like to learn something about:

-   What is the prevalence of diabetes among **U.S. adults**, and has it changed over time?

-   Is there a relationship between tumor type and five-year mortality in **breast cancer patients**?

-   Does the average amount of caffeine vary by vendor in **12 oz cups of coffee at UNC coffee shops**?

If we had data from every unit in the population, we could just calculate what we wanted and be done!

## Sampling from the population

Unfortunately, we (usually) have to settle with a **sample** from the population.

-   Ideally, the sample is **representative**, allowing us to use **probability and statistical inference** to make conclusions that are **generalizable** to the broader population of interest.

## Our Sleep Data

Based on our collective histogram, get in groups of 4 and discuss the following:

- What is our population? 

- What is our sample? 

- What does our sample show? Do we think it's representative of our population? Why or why not? 

- What limitations might we have? (How could we improve?)

## Sampling methods  {.smaller}

**Probability sampling** (e.g., simple random sampling, stratified, cluster, or multi-stage sampling)

-   All units have a known chance of being selected

-   More likely to be generalizable

-   Can be more expensive and time-consuming

**Non-probability sampling** (e.g. quota, convenience, or snowball sampling)

-   Some units unable to be selected, with no way of knowing size or effect of sampling errors

-   Less generalizable to population of interest

-   More convenient and less costly

## Study design

**Experimental** studies (e.g. randomized control trials (RCTs))

-   Researchers directly control exposures or treatment groups. 

-   Ability to make causal statements

-   Less real-world applicability and generalizability

**Observational** studies (e.g. surveys)

-   Researchers do not assign exposures or treatments

-   Real-world setting with lower burden on participants

-   Inability to prove causality

## Example  {.smaller}

- Study: The effect of a new diet on weight loss in adults

- Objective: To determine whether a new low-carbohydrate diet leads to significant weight loss compared to a standard diet in adults. 

- Study Design: 
  - Participants: 100 adults aged 25-45 with a BMI between 25 and 30
  - Randomization: Participants are randomly assigned to one of two groups: 
    - Group A: 50 participants following the new low-carb diet
    - Group B: 50 participants following a standard diet.
  - Intervention: Group A follows the new diet for 12 weeks, while Group B follows their usual diet (standard diet)
  - Outcome measurement: Weight of participants is measured before the study begins and after 12 weeks. 

## Example

::: {.callout-tip}
## In small groups, discuss the following:

- Is this study an observational or experimental study? Why?

## What can go wrong?  {.smaller}

- Depending on the study design and sampling methods, different types of bias occur (again, we don't have the full population, only a sample). 

- Examples include: 
  - Selection bias: sample does not accurately reflect target population
  - Reporting bias: tendency to under-report all information available
  - Many more: non-response bias, attrition bias, confounding, detection bias, lack of blinding, straight-up falsified data (this happens)...[and more!](https://catalogofbias.org/biases/)

## A few years ago...{.smaller}

![](images/lec-1/covid.PNG){width="100"}

[link to article](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33615345/)

- seroprevalence = level of pathogen in a population

- From Conclusion: "The estimated prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Santa Clara County implies that COVID-19 was likely more widespread than indicated by the number of cases in late March, 2020". 

## However...

![](images/lec-1/covid2.PNG){width="300"}

[What do some other people have to say about this study...?](https://medium.com/@balajis/peer-review-of-covid-19-antibody-seroprevalence-in-santa-clara-county-california-1f6382258c25)


## Three main issues brought up in blog  {.smaller}

1. Sampling bias

- Study recruited participants through Facebook ads, may have attracted people more concerned about COVID-19 or those who thought they were already exposed $\rightarrow$ overestimation of seroprevalence (level of pathogen in a population)

  - Symptomatic/exposed individuals may have signed up to get tested, especially when testing was limited. 
  
  - Participants may have recruited others in their network

- Without a truly random sample, findings are less generalizable and reproducible

## The issues, continued  {.smaller}

2. Statistical adjustments: High false positive rate could drive results

- Study had high false positive rate (2 FP out of 401 known negative samples, about 0.5%), but with a wide confidence interval! (FP Rate could be above 1.2%)

- Study reported only 50 positives out of ~3300 participants, so such a high FP rate could account for a significant portion - if not all - of the positive results. ($\frac{2}{401}\cdot 3300 = 17$) Yikes!

- It could even be more! (re-calibrate the assay on a different set of 401 known negative samples, you may get 0/401 FP or even 6/401). 

## The issues, continued

3. Transparency

- Study does not make its raw data, code, and full methodology publicly available

- Without access to these, other researchers cannot replicate the study or verify its findings, undermining the reproducibility of the research

- Transparency essential for the scientific process (particularly in high-stakes studies!)

## Reproducibility and replicability {.smaller}

-   **Reproducibility**: being able to take original data and code to reproduce all numerical findings.

-   **Replicability**: being able to independently repeat an entire study without use of the original data (generally with the same methods)

Best practices from the American Statistical Association:

-   End-to-end scripting of research

  - From the moment you "read in" your raw data, document the code you used for data cleaning, visualization, and analysis
-   Use of version control and documentation (we will not use this in our class)
-   Publication of code along with data

## Activity: Biostatistics for public good! {.smaller}

Step 1: Explore Google Scholar

- Search for a research paper where biostatistics is used to improve public health (e.g., studies on vaccines, health disparities, chronic disease prevention, environmental exposures, health policy).

Step 2: Share & Discuss

- Form groups of 3. Each person shares the paper they found. As a group, discuss:

- What is the paper studying? How are biostatistics being applied? Why is this meaningful or impactful for public health?

## Participation

Step 3: Reflect & Submit

- Take a screenshot of the abstract/front page of your chosen paper

- Write a short reflection (3–4 sentences):

  - What do you find interesting/important about the paper you chose?

  - How does it show the value of biostatistics?


Submit the screenshot + reflection on Canvas

Due **this Friday at 11:59pm**

## In this course, we will...

-   Apply descriptive techniques commonly used to summarize public health data.
-   Learn methods to analyze real-world data to answer research questions in a biomedical setting.
-   Use [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) within RStudio (now Posit) to write reproducible reports.
    - Reading in data, cleaning data, visualization, analysis, interpretation
-   Communicate results from statistical analyses to a general audience.
