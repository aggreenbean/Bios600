<h2>What have I gotten myself into?</h2>
<ul>
<li>BIOS 600 is an introduction to “principles of statistical inference” in biostatistics that:
<ul>
<li>provides a tour of basic statistical methods commonly encountered in public health and biomedical research,</li>
<li>emphasizes understanding of methods, using them to arrive at data-driven decisions, and effective communication of such results.</li>
<li>Utilizes modern software such as RStudio to reproducibly examine and manipulate data to make sound scientific conclusions</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<section id="activities-participate-practice-perform" class="slide level2 smaller">
<h2>Activities: Participate, Practice, Perform</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Participate:</strong> Attend and actively participate in lectures and labs, office hours</li>
<li><strong>Practice:</strong> Practice applying statistical concepts and computing with lab exercises (individual)
<ul>
<li>Review course topics with occasional participation exercises, typically a few questions administered via Canvas. Annotated notes will be uploaded after class.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Perform:</strong> Put together what you’ve learned to analyze real-world data
<ul>
<li>Homework assignments (individual)</li>
<li>Three in-class exams</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="cadence" class="slide level2">
<h2>Cadence</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lecture:</strong> Tuesday/Thursday 8am-9:15am. Mostly lecture, sometimes a participation activity (could be a quick survey, or an activity to apply your knowledge). Lectures will not be recorded, but annotated slides will be posted after each lecture.</li>
<li><strong>Labs:</strong> Tutorial video and assignment will (typically) be posted Monday around noon. Start and make large progress on Tuesday in lab section, finish up by Friday 11:59pm of that week</li>
<li><strong>HWs:</strong> Posted approx every 1-2 weeks, typically will have approximately 1 week to complete.</li>
<li><strong>Exams:</strong> 3 in-class exams, more info as semester progresses.</li>

<section id="what-to-expect-in-lab" class="slide level2">
<h2>What to expect in lab</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Lab session will be Tuesdays from 3:30-4:50, McGavran-Greenberg 1301, led by TA</p></li>
<li><p>Instructions and tutorial video will be posted on Canvas on Monday by noon.</p></li>
<li><p>I know some of you have a conflict w/ lab time. That’s okay - attendance is not required. Watch the video and work on the lab, attend other scheduled office hours if you need help. Still turn in the assignment <strong>by Friday at 11:59pm</strong> of that week.</p></li>

</section>
<section id="tips" class="slide level2">
<h2>Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>You do not have to finish the lab during the lab session, they will always be due that <strong>Friday at 11:59 pm</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>One work strategy is to get through portions that you think will be most challenging (which initially might be the coding component) during lab when a TA can help you on the spot and leave the narrative writing until later.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the time wisely to really learn the material and produce a quality report.</p></li>

<h2>Diversity + inclusion</h2>
<p>It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students’ learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have a name that differs from those that appear in your official UNC records, please let me know!</li>
<li>Please let me know your preferred pronouns. You’ll also be able to note this in the Getting to know you survey.</li>
<li>If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don’t hesitate to come and talk with me. I want to be a resource for you.</li>
<li>If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, your advisers and deans are excellent resources.</li>

<h2>Course policies: Late work</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>HW &amp; Labs: Deadlines are there to help you stay on track. However, I know that life happens! You have a 24-hour grace period to turn in any HW/Lab without penalty. <strong>No HW/Labs will be accepted after the 24-hour grace period</strong>, except in extenuating circumstances.</p></li>
<li><p>Lowest HW and Lab will be dropped.</p></li>
<li><p>No late work will be accepted for exams and the project.</p></li>

</section>
<section id="collaboration-policy" class="slide level2">
<h2>Collaboration policy</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Only work that is <strong>clearly assigned as team work</strong> should be completed collaboratively.</p></li>
<li><p>Homeworks must be completed <strong>individually</strong>. You may <strong>not</strong> directly share answers / code with others, however you are welcome to discuss the problems in general and ask for advice.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="ai-policy" class="slide level2">
<h2>AI policy</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Use of artificial intelligence (AI): You should treat AI tools, such as ChatGPT, the same as other online resources.</p></li>
<li><p>There are two guiding principles that govern how you can use AI in this course:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Cognitive dimension: Working with AI should not reduce your ability to think clearly. We will practice using AI to facilitate—rather than hinder—learning.</p></li>
<li><p>Ethical dimension: Students using AI should be transparent about their use and make sure it aligns with academic integrity.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="ai-for-code" class="slide level2">
<h2>AI for code</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>AI tools for code: You may make use of the technology for coding examples on assignments; if you do so, you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code, and share the AI prompt(s) you used.</p></li>
<li><p>Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="no-ai-for-narrative" class="slide level2">
<h2>No AI for narrative</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>No AI tools for narrative</strong>: Unless instructed otherwise, AI is not permitted for writing narrative on assignments. In general, you may use AI as a resource as you complete assignments but not to answer the exercises for you. You are ultimately responsible for the work you turn in; it should reflect your understanding of the course content.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="sharing-reusing-code-policy" class="slide level2 smaller">
<h2>Sharing / reusing code policy</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Unless explicitly stated otherwise, this course’s policy is that you may make use of any online resources (e.g.&nbsp;RStudio Community, StackOverflow, ChatGPT, etc.) but you must <strong>explicitly cite</strong> where you obtained any code you directly use or use as inspiration in your solution(s).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>I know that you will have access to the internet and AI in the real world</strong>. However, you are required to understand (&amp; be able to explain) every line of code you’re turning in.</p></li>
<li><p>Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism, regardless of source.</p></li>
